# Developing a management area for Hawaiʻi pelagic false killer whales

This repository contains files referenced in Oleson et al. (2023) that
pertain to the development of a new management area for the Hawaiʻi
pelagic stock of false killer whales. The first files, located in the
[data](https://github.com/PIFSC-Protected-Species-Division/HI-Pelagic-FKWs/tree/main/data)
folder, summarize the available biological data for Hawaiʻi pelagic
false killer whales, including the genetic sample, survey sighting, and
fishery interaction data. The metadata for these files are detailed
below. Each of the three data files can be downloaded by clicking on the
file of interest within the
[data](https://github.com/PIFSC-Protected-Species-Division/HI-Pelagic-FKWs/tree/main/data)
folder and then clicking on the “download raw file” button to the upper
right of the file preview. Note that the satellite telemetry data also
used to develop the new management area is available from the [Animal
Telemetry network](https://portal.atn.ioos.us/#metadata/137104/species).

The remaining files, located in the
[boundary](https://github.com/PIFSC-Protected-Species-Division/HI-Pelagic-FKWs/tree/main/boundary)
folder, comprise a shapefile of the new Hawaiʻi pelagic false killer
whale management area. The shapefile contains a line feature with a
current projection of WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_4N. The shapefile was created by
Amanda Bradford at the NOAA Fisheries Pacific Islands Fisheries Science
Center using the satellite telemetry, genetic sample, survey sighting,
and fishery interaction data as described in Oleson et al. (2023). For
ease and simplicity, metadata for the shapefile were entered using the
“Item Description” style in ArcGIS Desktop, but this may be updated in
the future.

Downloading individual components of a shapefile is not recommended;
however, downloading individual folders from GitHub is not intuitive.
The easiest way to obtain the management area boundary is to download
the repository by clicking on the green “Code” button in the upper right
of the repository
[homepage](https://github.com/PIFSC-Protected-Species-Division/HI-Pelagic-FKWs)
and selecting “Download ZIP”. You can then delete the files and folders
you do not need. If you have any questions or issues with any of the
files, please contact Amanda Bradford at amanda.bradford@noaa.gov.

## Genetic sample data

Sample locations of false killer whales within the central North Pacific
(defined as the area from the equator to 43°N, and from 175°E to 132°W)
were compiled for use in defining the Hawaiʻi pelagic false killer whale
management area. All processed samples collected to date (i.e., through
17 April 2021) were included, excluding those from the main Hawaiian
Islands insular and Northwestern Hawaiian Islands stocks. The resulting
file “01_pFKW_GenSamps_CNP_1997-2021.csv” contains the following
information:

## Survey sighting data

Sightings of false killer whales during NOAA Fisheries ship-based
line-transect surveys of the central North Pacific were extracted to
help guide the definition of the the Hawaiʻi pelagic false killer whale
management area. All sightings made to date (i.e., through 3 March 2020)
were included, excluding those of the main Hawaiian Islands insular and
Northwestern Hawaiian Islands stocks. The resulting file
“02_pFKW_SurSights_CNP_1986-2020.csv” contains the following

## Fishery interaction data

All false killer whale interactions with the Hawaiʻi-based longline
fisheries were aggregated to inform defining the Hawaiʻi pelagic false
killer whale management area. All interactions from 2001 through 2002
were included. The resulting file “03_pFKW_FishTakes_All_2001-2022.csv”
contains the following information:
